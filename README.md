# Maze-Pathfinding
This was a coding test to implement this playable maze game, that can load any map, and a pathfinder AI for it, that solves any map with the least amount of steps. This was my take on it in 2017. The implementation of the game itself is trivial, however implementing the pathfinder AI for it turned out to be quite challenging, mostly because of the trap mechanism.
